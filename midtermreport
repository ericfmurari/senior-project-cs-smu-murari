Midterm Report:

My project is to help convert the engineering curricula from Matlab to python. Python is more useful in this case due to several reasons, such as the ease of learning (both the language and further languages), ease of object oriented programming, functionalities, power, etc. It also is free, which will save the university a fair amount of money.

I have met with Dr. Picone twice and have acquired all necessary data and installed all necessary software. Now, all I need to do is start the conversion process. 
Dr.Picone suggested that I begin with one of the courses he is teaching this semester about control systems.

The plan:
To begin work on the conversion as soon as possible and hopefully complete it in the near future
My responsibilities will be the entire project.
